# DataSpoken

This project is created by Seon Kim as a participation in the Kaleido Developer Challenge.

This project aims to solve research data fabrication by freezing the raw research data on chain at initial time, and providing the connection between the data and the final outcome (e.g. research paper). The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end workflow through the UIs representing each party that is involved in the process.

## Progress
